### Description
The task performing professionals perform the service request such as ultrasound or labresearch. The results of the procedure are reqistered in a separate system and reported back to the requesting EHR. In this paragraph we focus on the data that is communicated to the main EHR. This guideline should make clear what kind of data is being communicated and to which subject this data belongs.

The data  of the results can be categorised in 3 classes:
* Data that is clearly only about the mother
* Data that is clearly only about ( one of) foetus(ses).
* Data that is about the pregnancy and shared with mother and foetus.
