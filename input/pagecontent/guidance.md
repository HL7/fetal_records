### Scenario's

#### Introduction on the scenario's
We have simplified the different types of use cases and scenarios in characteristics of the workflow. We call them the basic use cases. The simplification means that they contain  a high level of abstraction, where the focus is on the intent of the work process:
* a medication request: the care provider places a request to perform a certain medication to either the mother or one of the fetusses.
* result reporting: as a result of the service request the results of either the mother, the fetusses or the pregnancy are reported to the service requestor.
* data transfer: medical records are transferred from one system to the other. This could be data from the mother, fetus or the pregnancy itself.
